## GitHub Profile Overview:
Started in autumn 2022, this profile tracks my web coding progress from basic PHP to advanced frameworks during my ongoing education. It houses repositories featuring code from solo and collaborative school projects, with clear credits for contributors. Each repository includes project comments, deployment links, and some have code reviews.

### Future Plans:
At the halfway point in my course, I plan to add more finished projects, including a significant graduation project in autumn. The final semester (January to June 2024) will be dedicated to workplace-based learning (LIA), with the future use of this space yet to be determined. Exciting times ahead! 😄
