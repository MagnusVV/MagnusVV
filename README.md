## About this Github profile
I created this profile at the start of my education early autumn 2022. As of now it consists of repositories with the code from my larger school projects. For myself, it's a nice way to see my own gradual progress in web coding, from simpler PHP projects to more advanced projects using frameworks. For others, it's a good way to follow my journey, but also to get a grasp on the breatdh of what we learn during this web developer course.

### So what's on here?
As mentioned above, one will find a handful of repositories with the code from my school projects. Some projects are entirely my own, while others are collaborations with other students. In the case of collaborations, the other participants' names (or nicks) will be credited, and forked repositories will be shown as forked. Every repository will have some small comments about its project. A number of them also contains code reviews from fellow students.

### The future
I'm now halfway through the course, so the idea is for the amount of finished projects here to grow, including the large examination project come this autumn (scary but exciting). The final semester, January to June 2024, will be dedicated entirely to LIA (workplace-based learning), so what happens with this space during that time I don't really know yet. I bet it will be put to good use, though. 😀
